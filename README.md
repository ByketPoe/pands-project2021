# pands-project2021
This is for Emma Farrell's submission of the project for programming and scripting module.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use Python to interpret the Iris Data Set through a Data Analytics lens. 

### Reading from the File
The file downloaded from the site is a simple text file. The values are all separated using commas, so I have saved it as a .csv file (comma separated values). The Pandas library is able to read in csv files and process them in a way that makes it easy to perform analysis on the data and output it to plots.
