Notes

I have two files, one with a bunch of numbers, the other with info on those numbers. Saving the info as a text file, the numbers as a CSV
Need to sort out the files; need headers on the lists of data, also might be useful to separate out the three groups into different files? 
Use pandas dataframes for the data

Plotting
Histogram
Box Plots 
Bean Plots
Scatter - Correlation
Parallel coordinate plot
3d plots?
